This will be the first meetup stemming from the previous post for those of us that want to dedicate time every week to work on their side projects, even if we have other jobs. Here are the details:

The plan is for us to get some work done on our own side projects and meet other developers/entrepreneurs while we're at it. I'll create a small sign or something to identify myself with. Let me know if you have any location or time suggestions for future events.
