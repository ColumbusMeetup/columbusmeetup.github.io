We'll be back to the normal time and location this week.  Mission Coffee was a bit less busy this past week, so I'm not expecting any space issues.

Also be sure to sign up for the mailing list for announcments and reminders about future meetups.

As always, the plan is to show up at the coffee shop and work on our own projects for a few hours and meet some other people doing the same.  Still figuring out your project?  Come bounce some ideas off of us if you want.  Need a second set of eyes for a new design?  Find them here!  Just want to focus on getting stuff done for a few hours a week?  Get it done in good company.
