Hey everyone, we have a couple notes about this week's meetup.

1. This week's meetup will be 1 hour earlier than normal to accommodate for anyone that wants to watch the democratic debate at 7pm.

2. We'll meet at Mission Coffee again, despite it being a little crowded last week.  I've never seen Mission Coffee so busy on a Tuesday evening, so I'm hopeful that last week was a one-time anomaly.

3. Be sure to subscribe to the mailing list for reminders and last-minute updates on meetups.  If anything happens the day or the meetup, the mailing list is the easiest way to reach everyone.

As always, the plan is to show up at the coffee shop and work on our own projects for a few hours and meet some other people doing the same.  Still figuring out your project?  Come bounce some ideas off of us if you want.  Need a second set of eyes for a new design?  Find them here!
