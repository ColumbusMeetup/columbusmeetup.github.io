Happy New Year everyone!  After a bit of a hiatus during the holidays, we're back and ready to get to work again!

Have a project or startup you're working on?  Come and work on it at the coffee shop for a few hours and meet some other people doing the same.

Still figuring out your project?  Let's chat and bounce ideas around.

Working on a new design?  Get a second set of eyes for feedback.

Just want to focus on getting stuff done for a few hours a week?  Get it done in good company and with great coffee!
