Keep yourself motivated and make some progress on your side project or startup at the third Short North Entrepreneurial Meetup. Although we just started a couple weeks ago, the goal is to make this a weekly meetup.

The general plan is for us to get some work done on our side projects and startups for a few hours and meet other developers and entrepreneurs in the Columbus area while we're at it. As last week, I'll have a small sign for the group.
